    summary: |
      - To address the issue of measuring and mitigating light pollution in diverse locations, we have developed two distinct models: the Light Pollution Level Evaluation Model and the Optimal Light Pollution Intervention Model.
      - We established a comprehensive four-level evaluation indicator system, acquired the central standard value matrix through the K-means clustering algorithm, and the Entropy-weighted TOPSIS method. These efforts culminated in the successful completion of our research article titled Chasing Better Strategies for Light Pollution Intervention.
